## 🚀 Project Overview

The initial assignment focused on basic structure with **HTML** and **CSS**, but we decided to go beyond expectations. We added enhanced interactivity and advanced layout features using **JavaScript** and **Bootstrap 5**.

This hands-on project helped us learn how to collaborate effectively, divide responsibilities, and apply real-world development workflows.
